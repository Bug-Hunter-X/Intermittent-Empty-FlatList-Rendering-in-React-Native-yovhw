# React Native FlatList Intermittent Empty Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native intermittently renders an empty list despite successfully fetching data. The issue is inconsistent and difficult to reliably reproduce.

## Bug Description

A FlatList component is used to display data fetched from an API.  In some instances, the FlatList remains empty even after the API request completes successfully and the data is available.  The problem doesn't occur every time the app runs, making debugging challenging.

## Reproduction Steps

While consistent reproduction is not possible, the problem seems to be more likely to occur under conditions of high load or frequent UI updates.

1. Run the app.
2. Observe the FlatList.  Sometimes it will render correctly; other times it will be empty.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring data is properly updated in the state, including explicit key management for FlatList items.  See `bugSolution.js` for a corrected version.
